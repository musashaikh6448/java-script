      const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];

      const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];

      document.write(numbersCombined);

    using with destructuring

    <script>
      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

      const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;

      document.write("<p>" + one + "</p>");
      document.write("<p>" + two + "</p>");
      document.write("<p>" + rest + "</p>");
    </script>

    spread in object
    <script>
      const myVehicle = {
        brand: "Ford",
        model: "Mustang",
        color: "red",
      };

      const updateMyVehicle = {
        type: "car",
        year: 2021,
        color: "yellow",
      };

      const myUpdatedVehicle = { ...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle };

      //Check the result object in the console:
      console.log(myUpdatedVehicle);
    </script>

    Notice the properties that did not match were combined, but the property
    that did match, color, was overwritten by the last object that was passed,
    updateMyVehicle. The resulting color is now yellow. Q)Use the spread
    operator to combine the following arrays. const arrayOne = ['a', 'b', 'c'];
    const arrayTwo = [1, 2, 3];
