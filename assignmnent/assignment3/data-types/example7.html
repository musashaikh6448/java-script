    <h2>JavaScript Strings</h2>

    <p>
      You can use quotes inside a string, as long as they don't match the quotes
      surrounding the string:
    </p>

    <p id="demo"></p>

    <script>
      let string1 = "It's alright";
      let string2 = "He is called 'Johnny'";
      let string3 = 'He is called "Johnny"';

      document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML =
        string1 + "<br>" + string2 + "<br>" + string3;
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
